# Day 03 â€“ Secure Root SSH Access (KodeKloud Challenge)

## Overview
This repository contains my work for **Day 3 of KodeKloud Linux/DevOps Challenge**, where the task was to **disable direct root SSH login** on all application servers for **Project Nautilus** deployed in the Stratos Datacenter.

## Objective
- Enhance server security by preventing direct root SSH login.
- Maintain normal user access for administrative tasks.
- Apply best practices for SSH configuration and service management.

## Steps Performed
1. Connected to app servers (`stapp01`, `stapp02`, `stapp03`) via jump host.
2. Backed up the SSH configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak
